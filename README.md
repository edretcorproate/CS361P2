# Project #: NFA States

* Author: Emi Dretcanu
* Class: CS361 Section #

## Overview

This project is about programming NFA's into java code. This program will require
a few methods that will trace all NFA's given to it to see if it is a valid NFA and
if the NFA can be properly traced through.

## Reflection

What worked well was half of the methods could just borrowed from the previous DFA project.
What was a struggle was that I didn't have enough time on my hands to do everything by myself
so the project has flaws. The concepts were clear, so I didn't have trouble understanding the
concepts.

The techniques that I chose were just just follow along with the provided tests which
helped me debug and test my code. The only thing I would change about my design process
is give myself more time to develop the program if i am going solo. Other than that
the project itself wasn't bad.

If I could go back in time I wouldn't tell myself anything as it would not have changed the
end result of the project. The only thing that could change the projects grade is if I had
more time.

## Compiling and Using

Use javac *.java to compile (for each file).
Use eclipse to run the test suit.
